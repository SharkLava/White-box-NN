# Neural Network on Rust
This is an implementation of a neural network from scratch, used to identify hand written numbers using the MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

the NN is comprised of a input layer with 784 nodes (28x28), a hidden layers with 10 nodes and a output layer with 10 nodes.
