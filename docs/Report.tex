\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgb0af926}
In this report I will go over my experiences with implementing a whitebox ANN in Rust.
For this task I decided to create a simple neural network that would attempt to recognize the digits from the MNIST dataset.

\section{Usage}
\label{sec:org537ea94}
Run
\begin{verbatim}
  cargo run Cargo.toml
\end{verbatim}

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:org3f5f05f}
The ANN reads data from a modified version of the MNIST dataset that was converted into a file for easier reading. I also trained the model on the test dataset(which consisted of 10000 entries and tested the performance using the first 200 elements in the train data set, as I was running short of computational resources)

The ANN also has:
\begin{itemize}
\item 28\textsuperscript{2} nodes in the input layer
\item 10 nodes in the hidden layer
\item 10 nodes in the output layer
\end{itemize}
I also ended up using 2 different activation function combinations to see which one performed better.
The first was the sigmoid function and the other was a combination of the ReLU function and the Softmax function.

\section{Performance}
\label{sec:org24f1928}
At 1000 epochs with learning rate = 0.2

\section{Final Thoughts}
\label{sec:org967720f}
Despite the many, many places this project can be improved upon like
\begin{enumerate}
\item Multithreading
\item Cleaner and more optimized code
\item Fix all the warnings
\item Build to a crate(?)
\item Use the actual dataset
\item Use GPU throught the RustCUDA project
\end{enumerate}

The neural networks do perform decently well.
